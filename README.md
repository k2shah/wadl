WADL is a python package for planning surveys over large areas using one or more UAV (Unpersoned Aerial Vehicle). WADL take in a geofence and desired gird spacing and produces a series of routes to survey the area inside the geofence. 

The project was motivated by the need for efficient route planning for multi-robot systems. WADL was designed and used in a 2019-2020 survey of 
Ad√©lie penguins over [Cape Crozier, Ross Island, Antarctica](https://goo.gl/maps/wrMTuMq5kyNxZafx8) If you are interested in the technical details please see our [paper](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/5/47/eabc3000)  To cite wadl please use the following citation:

## Install
### pip
```
pip install wadl-planner
```
### source
```
git clone https://github.com/k2shah/wadl.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Quick Start
```
from wadl.survey import Survey
survey = Survey()
survey.addTask(<path_to_geofence.csv>, step=100)
survey.plan()
```
Where ``step`` is the desired grid spacing.
