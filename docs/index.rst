Coverage Path Planner
========================

``wadl`` is a python package for planning surveys over large areas using one or more UAV (Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle). WADL take in a geofence and desired gird spacing and produces a series of routes to survey the area inside the geofence. 

``wadl`` is licensed under GPL v3. More information can be found in the :ref:`license` section.

Motivation
----------

The project was motivated by the need for efficient route planning for multi-robot systems. WADL was designed and used in a 2019-2020 survey of Adélie penguins over `Cape Crozier`_, Ross Island, Antarctica.

Overview
--------
``wadl`` works by taking in a geofence and a desired lattice spacing to overlay a grid on the geofenced region. This is the geofence of the Cape Cozier Adélie penguin rookery.

It will then split this grid into smaller isolated sub-grid.

For each of these sub-grids it will find a cyclical path through the grid such that each point on the sub-grid is visited at least once.

Finally it will link together these smaller paths into a bigger path. An optional "home" point can be added. The final length can be adjusted by setting a flight time limit.

The final set of paths are exported as a csv file and can be imported into other flight control software. We provide tools to export routes to UGCS_.
