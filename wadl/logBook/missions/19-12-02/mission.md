## Notes
- Had 1 drone go off route briefly, but recovered quickly
- Some photos are still blurry despite screen tapping 
- encountered the speedy error again on all drones, but hard reset of the app and remote seem to fix the problem 
- Walking back and forth between Pat's Peak is a difficult to do safely
- Waddle2 had a loss of RC resulting in a home point return failsafe. KS landed manually from afar with help of PL. 
- W1 F3, W2 F2 (x2), W3 F3 were all "speedy" (x2 for ran twice)
- Used 18 batteries (2 were recharged)
